            This week I read an article explaining modern JavaScript. I have known how to use HTML and CSS<br>
             but never really had a good grasp on JS. This article explained to me how HTML and JavaScript <br>
             can interact with one another to improve the quality (and readability) of a website.<br>
            I learned that you can include JS scripts in HTML. This is shown in the following code:<br>
    <b><pre>
    &lt!-- index.html --&gt
    &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt
    &lthtml lang="en"&gt
    &lthead&gt
        &ltmeta charset="UTF-8"&gt
        &lttitle&gtJavaScript Example&lt/title&gt
        &ltscript src="index.js"&gt&lt/script&gt
    &lt/head&gt
    &ltbody&gt
        &lth1&gtHello from HTML!&lt/h1&gt
    &gt/body&lt
    &lt/html&gt
</pre></b>
    We can link a JS script with the script keyword in HTML and then call functions from that script's library.<br>
    It is also interesting that you can use functions from JavaScript in the order they are added to the <br>
    HTML file. So if I add a JS file before another one, I can call the first scripts methods in the second script.<br><br><br><br>

    The second part of the article that I read was about package managers. Back before managers existed you had to<br>
    manually type many lines of code to install certain libraries. You would need to manually type all the code on the<br>
    right just to install one JS library called moment.js:   <br>

    Also, everytime a library is updated you would have to search and update it as well as your code . Package<br>
    managers greatly simplify this process. Package managers essentially auto-update the libraries you use and store them<br>
    for you locally. The article discusses how easy package managers make updating the libraries you use, however, it also<br>
    discusses the downsides to using package managers. Mainly, having to search through the manager folders to find each <br>
    library so that you can add it to your different HTML files.<br><br> 
    I only covered the first two sections of this article for this first blog, but I plan to continure reading it for future<br>
    blog posts so that I can continue to increase my knowledge about JavaScript, HTML and how they interact with one another.
