        <p>This week I read an article on the arguments for and against HTML being a programming language. This author <br>
        isn't trying to prove that HTML <b>IS</b> a programming language, but they are trying to explain why the arguments <br>
         against it being one are flawed. The first point the author brings up is that most people often say that HTML is a <br>
         markup language so therefore, it cannot be a programming language. Although most of the time this is true, it is <br>
         not <b>always</b> the case!!</p> <br>
        <img src= venn.JPG width = 400 height = 300>
        <p>There is some overlap like shown in the image above. So, while this doesn't prove that HTML is a programming <br>
        language, is does disprove that commonly used statement. <br><br><br>
        The next common misconception people make about HTML is that because it doesn't have logic it can't be a programming<br>
        language. This is again false because while HTML may not have if statements or loops, it does have some pieces to it<br>
        that can be considered "logic". It has things such as variables and control structures.</p>
        <img src = code.JPG width = 400 height = 300> <br>
        <p>This source code shows the details and summary keywords used which turns out actually implement some basic logic. So, <br>
        here we have another common misunderstanding disproved.<br><br><br>
        The last misconception covered is that HTML is not "turing complete" therefore it is not a programming language. <br>
        In layman's terms a programming is "turing complete" if it can be implemented in such a way that it can mimic the <br>
        actions of any turing machine. The author says that while HTML may not meet today's standard of "turing complete" <br>
        this may not mean that it isn't. The author uses the example of Minecraft. He says that the game is undoubtedly "turing <br>
        complete" but most people wouldn't call it a programming language. Again, this doesn't prove that HTML is turing <br>
        complete or that it is a programming language. But it does prove that the term "turing complete" is subjective and <br>
        may not be the best identifier for what a programming language is. <br><br><br>

        I liked this article because instead of taking the common route and trying to prove something. The author instead <br>
        goes about refuting the false statements made about HTML. Whether HTML is a programming language or not will be <br>
        argued about for many years to come. However, since it seems it can't be proven that it is <b>not</b>, the answer <br>
        may still be up in the air.
